Positional Window Switcher
==========================

The Positional Window Switcher will allow the user to issue a keyboard shortcut to change the window focus to the nearest window in a cardinal direction (left, right, up, down, in front, behind).

It will use the X Window system libraries in C and hopefully work under openbox.

Flow
----

* Get current window position
* Fetch list of all windows and positions
** XQueryTree()
** http://cboard.cprogramming.com/linux-programming/125534-accessing-windows-x11.html
** get a list of windows and print out their names
* Compare current position to other window positions
** Generally want nearest window to right that I'm not covering, i.e. smallest positive distance between edges (his left vs my right)
* Decide which window to switch to
* switch (using XSetInputFocus?)

Challenges
----------

PWS will have to run in the background, yet it will have to intercept keyboard commands.  I can get around this by having it be a command line argument and have an openbox shortcut.  So the command line must contain the info necessary as far as what direction to switch.  I don't think openbox will change the focus just for a keyboard shortcut.

This will make debugging a little easier since I'll be constantly switching the window nearest right of wherever I'm coding.
